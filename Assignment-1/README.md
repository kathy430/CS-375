# Assignment 1

I like the website [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) because I can see the code of each project and modify/compile it myself. I also
enjoy how we can comment on each project and give feedback to the creator. It's interesting to see how some projects have been created years 
ago, but there are still people who have looked at and commented on the post recently. The only reason why I don't really like Shadertoy is 
because most projects I try to play are laggy with low frame rates. I'm not quite sure how to make the fps higher for the projects I run. I do notice 
that when I run the projects, my CPU usage increases quite a bit so it might be because my CPU isn't powerful enough, but I don't seem to have
low fps on the Experiments with Google site.
